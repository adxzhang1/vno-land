## Overview

- Vue is an approachable javascript framework with an exciting ecosystem with
  remarkable versatility. Deno is a runtime environment intent on improving the
  shortcomings of node.js. We wanted to be able to leverage the Vue framework in
  a Deno runtime environment, and vno makes that possible.

## How to use vno

- You can use the vno Command Line Interface to quickly create a new Vue project
  in a Deno runtime
- OR you can use the vno build method to compile an existing Vue file structure
  into a Deno-legible .js file

### vno installation

- vno requires the use of Deno version 1.10 or above
- run the following command in your terminal to install vno on your machine.

```
deno install --allow-net --unstable https://deno.land/x/vno/install/vno.ts
```

- Deno requires the `--allow-net` permission to run an installation
- This feature, and many of the others used in vno are still considered
  "unstable" for Deno. Run the command with `--unstable` to allow these
  resources to execute.
- The force flag `-f` can be used if you want to overwrite an existing copy of
  the module
- You can name the module in your path with the name flag `-n` or `--name` ,
  'vno' is the default name.
- If you have not already added Deno bin into your path, you will need to do so.

  - Copy the export path your terminal returns and paste it into your terminal

### a quick word about permissions

- Deno is secure by default, this means that explicit permissions are required
  for certain tasks.
- You can avoid responding to the permissions requests by flagging the
  installation script.
- Most of our module requires both read and write permissions `--allow-read` &
  `--allow-write`
- If you decide not to flag permissions at installation, you will be prompted in
  the terminal after executing a command.
- **note: If you would like to avoid writing out the permissions altogether, you
  can also use the `-A` or `--allow-all` tag**

### vno config

- vno.config.json should be in the root of your project
- following is a description of the object interface:

```
interface Config {
    entry: string;
      //entry is the path to root component's directory : i.e. './client/'
    root: string;
      //root is the filename of your root component : i.e. 'App'
    vue?: 2 | 3;
      //vue is the number 2 or 3 : 2 = vue v2.6.12 (default); 3 = vue v3.0.5 
    options?: {
      port?: number;
        //preferred port for the dev server : defaults to `3000`
      title?: string;
        //title of your project
      hostname?: string;
        //preferred host : defaults to `0.0.0.0`
    };
  }
```

## CLI

### create a new project

- Project name will become the directory that holds your project (you must CD
  into project directory after running create command).
- If project name argument is omitted, then project will be created in current
  working directory.

```
vno create [project name]
```

- _OR_ If you'd rather not install:

```
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net --unstable https://deno.land/x/vno/install/vno.ts create [project name]
```

### run a build on a project

- To invoke the build method and dynamically create bundled js and css files for
  your application type the following into the terminal:

```
vno build
```

_OR_

```
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net --unstable https://deno.land/x/vno/install/vno.ts build
```

**It is important to know that as of now, scoped styling is not supported**

### run a build on a project AND create a server configured for SSR

- To invoke the build method and dynamically create bundled js, css files, and a server.ts for server side rendering your application, type the following into the terminal:

```
vno build --ssr
```
_OR_

```
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net --unstable https://deno.land/x/vno/install/vno.ts build --ssr
```

### run dev server includes live reload

- Running the dev server dynamically runs a new build and runs the application
  on a module hosted server
- Native `vno run dev` command automatically enables live reload
    - Live reload injects a WebSocket connection to build.js. Remove it with: `vno run build`
- Invoke the dev server like so:

```
vno run dev
```

_OR_

```
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net --unstable https://deno.land/x/vno/install/vno.ts run dev
```

# vno as an API

### initializing your application with the api

- You can import vno into your application with the following URL :
  `https://deno.land/x/vno/dist/mod.ts` With a vno.config.json, no argument is
  needed The API will search for the config and apply it to your application

```
import { Factory } from 'https://deno.land/x/vno/dist/mod.ts';

const vno = new Factory();
await vno.build();
```

without a vno.config.json, you can input the object directly into the Factory
instance

```
import { Factory } from 'https://deno.land/x/vno/dist/mod.ts';

const vno = Factory.create({
  root: "App",
  entry: "./"
  vue: 3,
  options: {
    port: 3000
  }
})

await vno.build();
```

`vno.build()` will run a build on the entire application and compile it to a
"vno-build" directory as one javascript file and one css file.

### accessing component object storage

- After running the build, parsed components are accessible inside the storage
  property on the Factory class.

```
vno.storage.get('App');
```

the argument accepted by the get method for storage is the component filename
