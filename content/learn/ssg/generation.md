## Time to generate our project

Vno offers a simple CLI command so that all of our deployment files get generated into the dist folder.


From your command line, in your projects root, run the following *build* command:

```
vno ssg build
```
## Voila! Your build files have appeared!

This will have created a '**dist**' folder in your projects root directory. 

## Ready To Deploy!

You now have a static version of your app in the '**dist**' directory.
